1. selection of data : 3 products 3 provinces.

3. measures of scatter (for the selected product, bivariate - the division by province should be taken into account)

4. graphs : frequency histogram and boxplot - all three products

5. interval estimation : confidence interval for the mean, minimum sample size (for the selected product, two-person - should take into account the division into provinces)

6. testing of average values (test of average value for the price of the selected product and comparison of two averages for provinces or years)
